# SonoffToolMac
 This is the same tool from: https://github.com/itead/Sonoff_Devices_DIY_Tools
 Please refer to that repository for all the instructions. Here I will only document the MacOS specific instructions.
 
 You only need the SonoffToolMac.app downloaded to you Mac. Once that is done, there are two possible ways of openning the applications.
 
 1. The simplest being to just open the app like any normal app (double tap/click)
